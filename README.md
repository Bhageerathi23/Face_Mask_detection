# Face_Mask_detection
# Objective
This project aims to detect the presence or absence of face masks in real-time video streams. Using computer vision and deep learning techniques, it helps in identifying individuals wearing masks, contributing to public health measures during health crises.

# Features
Real-time Face Detection: Identifies faces in live video streams using pre-trained models.
Mask Presence Classification: Determines if faces in the video stream are wearing masks or not.
Live Video Visualization: Shows the live video feed with face detection and mask presence labels.

# Usage
Objective: To provide real-time detection of face masks in video streams.
Features: Utilizes computer vision and deep learning for face and mask detection.
How to Use: Run the project to view live video with mask presence labels.
